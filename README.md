## Install Virtual Environment
We use a module named virtualenv which is a tool to create isolated Python environments. virtualenv creates a folder that contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.

```c
pip install virtualenv
Create Python virtual environment
```

Go to the local directory where you want to create your Flask app.

```c
virtualenv venv
```

Activate a virtual environment based on your OS

```c
For windows > venv\Scripts\activate
For linux > source ./venv/bin/activate
```
